# Iterative-Closest-Point-in-Lidar-Sensor-Data
The purpose of this repository is to utilize a dataset of sensor scans obtained from LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) data and find a path using its Cloud Points and a hand-written ICP(Iterative Closest Point Algorithm). Also comparing this implementation with the library implementation and optimal path.
